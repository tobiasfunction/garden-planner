## About

A console program to calculate how many vegetables can be grown in a bed of a certain size.

This program was initially created as a project for [@AcademyPgh](https://github.com/AcademyPgh), which has grown beyond the scope of the original assignment as I endeavour to better understand C#'s classes and data structures.

This is a work in progress; see [todo.md](/todo.md) for a more comprehensive list of features I'd like to implement.

## Features

- Calculate based on the dimensions of a bed, or provide square footage.
- Get a recommended number of plants-per-row and rows-per-bed in addition to the total number of plants.
- View list of plants available in the database.

## Tech

- Written in C# on .NET 6.
- Utilizes a MySQL database of plants and their spacing requirements.
- Implements a custom markup language for simple, operating-system-agnostic terminal colors.
