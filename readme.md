# Garden Planner

> This program was initially created as a project for [@AcademyPgh](https://github.com/AcademyPgh), which has grown beyond the scope of the original assignment as I endeavour to better understand C#'s classes and data structures.
> This is a work in progress; see [todo.md](/todo.md) for a more comprehensive list of features I'd like to implement.
